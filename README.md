# Alzheimer’s Disease Detection from MRI Using Deep Learning 🧠  

This project focuses on the **automatic classification of Alzheimer’s disease stages** using MRI brain scans and deep learning techniques.  
The system was developed as part of a bachelor’s thesis, motivated by the major global impact of Alzheimer’s disease.  

---

## ✨ Overview
- Classified MRI scans into **four disease stages**.  
- Worked with **6,400+ MRI images**.  
- Addressed **class imbalance** with oversampling and data augmentation.  
- Trained both a **custom CNN** and pre-trained models:  
  - VGG16  
  - InceptionV3  
  - ResNet50   
- Built a **lightweight interface** integrating the best-performing model for ease of use.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib  
- **Machine Learning Utilities**: scikit-learn  

---

## 📊 Results
- **InceptionV3**: 98% accuracy (best performing model).  
- CNN and other pre-trained models also evaluated with hyperparameter tuning.  
- Confusion matrices and classification reports used for performance analysis.
